# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎅

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This project contains solutions to the daily programming challenges from the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) event. These challenges are a fun way to practice problem-solving skills, explore algorithms, and improve coding proficiency across various topics.

## 📖 About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual event that runs from December 1st to December 25th. Each day, participants solve two coding puzzles, earning a star for each completed puzzle. It's a great opportunity to compete with friends, learn new techniques, and have fun!

## 🚀 Project Structure
This repository organizes solutions by day, with each day having two parts.
```
├── Day_1/
│   ├── part_a.py
│   ├── part_b.py
│   └── input.txt
├── Day_2/
│   ├── part_a.py
│   ├── part_b.py
│   └── input.txt
...
└── README.md
```

- Each folder (e.g., `Day_1`) contains:
  - **`parta.py`**: Script for solving Part 1 of the day's puzzle.
  - **`part2bpy`**: Script for solving Part 2 of the day's puzzle.
  - **`input.txt`**: The input data for that day.

## 🛠️ Requirements
To run the solutions, you'll need:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Optional: A virtual environment for dependency management

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 🏃 How to Run

Navigate to the folder for the day you want to run.

Execute the script for the desired part using Python:
```
python part_a.py
```
OR:
```
python part_b.py
```

## 📝 Notes

- Input files: Each day's input.txt contains my unique input. Replace it with your own input from the Advent of Code website.
- Performance: Some solutions are optimized for speed, but feel free to suggest improvements!
- Approach: Each solution includes comments explaining the logic.

## 🤝 Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have an alternative solution, optimization idea, or bug fix, feel free to open a pull request.
